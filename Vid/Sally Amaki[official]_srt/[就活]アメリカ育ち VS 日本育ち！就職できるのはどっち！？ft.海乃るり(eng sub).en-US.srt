00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,000
Good morning everyone it's Sally Amaki

2
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:16,400
Today's video is going to be with my member Ruri Umino

3
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:30,100
if a girl born and raised in America and a girl born and raised in Japan took a job interview, we're pretty sure it's gonna be different so today we tried it out.

4
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:40,900
The jokes I made in Japanese don't really translate well in english but I'm putting subtitles anyway

5
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,000
LET'S GO

6
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,900
Please Introduce yourself

7
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:50,100
My name is Ruri Umino. I've worked as a voice actor and an idol in my past job

8
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:55,400
therefore I know the importance of communicating with people through my words and body language

9
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,155
and I believe that doing so is my speciality.

10
00:00:59,155 --> 00:01:02,335
Thank you for giving me your time of day today

11
00:01:02,335 --> 00:01:04,500
IDK how to translate YOROSHIKUONEGAISHIMASU

12
00:01:05,775 --> 00:01:08,805
EXCUSE ME I'M SO SORRY I'M LATE

13
00:01:08,805 --> 00:01:12,400
I'm Sally Amaki nice to meet you

14
00:01:13,585 --> 00:01:17,800
WAIT JUST LISTEN. On my way over here, I saw an old lady drowning in the river and

15
00:01:17,955 --> 00:01:25,700
I'm the type that can't leave those people behind so it took me some time to help her

16
00:01:26,225 --> 00:01:36,000
But because you all patiently waited for me, another life was saved so thank you so much for that

17
00:01:36,325 --> 00:01:38,500
So, shall we begin?

18
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,000
Do you have any management  experience?

19
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:45,495
I do not have any management experience but I did have somebody that did during my previous job

20
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:50,220
therefore, I'm aware of what is required for the job.

21
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:58,500
Yes. I mean all my life I've been supported, in other words managed, by those around me

22
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,500
but ever since I realized that the only one who is capable of managing me is myself,

23
00:02:02,725 --> 00:02:07,199
I've been my very own manager.

24
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:11,300
How would those around you rate you?

25
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:19,900
Many people tell me that I have the ability to take action quite fast. I'm the type of person who would start working the second I come up with something

26
00:02:20,165 --> 00:02:27,500
Therefore, if I get into this company, I would like to make use of those qualities of mine and bring in new ideas to the company

27
00:02:28,195 --> 00:02:37,299
Okay well my friends and family don't really 'rate' people with numbers cuz that's rude so it's kinda hard to answer your question

28
00:02:37,485 --> 00:02:55,300
but I get all As on my report card and my name's on the Dean's list too so if we're talking numbers, you can say the results come out to say that I'm perfect

29
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,100
What were you doing during the time you had off after quitting your previous job?

30
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:06,975
I contacted my previous manager to learn the basics of the job to prepare myself

31
00:03:06,975 --> 00:03:10,105
I also traveled to places I've never gone to to reflect on myself.

32
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,900
I went on a journey to find myself

33
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:22,200
I believe it was around a year ago, as I was walking around Southeast Asia, I looked down and saw my own shadow spreading from my toes into the wilderness.

34
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:27,200
The moment I saw that shadow, I felt as if I found myself.

35
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,900
I've been all around the world trying to find myself only to realize that I've been here all along. My shadow here proves my existence in this world.

36
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,100
How would you finish a job you find to be boring?

37
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:45,400
I've never found a job to be boring. I finish each job knowing that it all makes me grow as a person.

38
00:03:46,075 --> 00:03:48,144
I'd probably just be like

39
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,400
but do it anyway

40
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,900
What do you think this industry would be like in 10 years?

41
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:07,100
Compared to 10 years ago, there are so many more jobs that allow for people to be in the spotlight. For instance youtubers and virtual youtubers.

42
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:19,200
Therefore, 10years from now I believe that there will be even more opportunities for people in show business and so along with that, more managers would be required for them.

43
00:04:19,805 --> 00:04:24,100
Well the future's going to change depending on you hiring me or not.

44
00:04:24,525 --> 00:04:34,000
If you don't hire me, I can see that this company won't be able to keep up with the entertainment business and the changes they go through every 5 seconds.

45
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:38,900
If I'm here, I can globalize this whole company and make it be known worldwide.

46
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,100
This job is hard for both men and women, would you be able to handle that?

47
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:47,555
If you will hire me, I promise that I will finish every job.

48
00:04:47,555 --> 00:04:53,900
I'll have a strong mentality and try my very best at everything.

49
00:04:54,200 --> 00:05:08,900
Well if it's hard for both men and women, what is there to be scared of? We'll all just go down together as a whole. TEAMWORK yay

50
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,200
When do you find your job rewarding?

51
00:05:11,385 --> 00:05:24,300
It's not like I work in hopes of getting praised but whenever people tell me 'thank you' or 'good job' it pushes me to keep trying hard.

52
00:05:24,425 --> 00:05:26,065
PAYDAY

53
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,000
Do you have any questions for us?

54
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:36,685
What position do you want to play in this industry in the future?

55
00:05:37,245 --> 00:05:39,900
Yea uh, when should I start?
