Internet

9
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:25,650
well I've seen it on an internet for

10
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:27,390
about two months now so I'm kind of late

11
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:29,159
but better late than never

12
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:30,480
spoiler alert this video is literally

13
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,369
going to be me just mixing these

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,079
ingredients together so if you have

15
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:36,180
better things to do which studies have

16
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,010
shown that 99.9 percent of the human

17
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:39,809
population usually have better things to

18
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:41,550
do than to watch me do anything of any

19
00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:44,040
sort no hard feelings

20
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:45,959
go do what you have to do but for those

21
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,730
of you that decide to stay there may

22
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,340
come a day when you need something from

23
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:52,500
me and when that day comes I will

24
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:56,760
remember this very moment and the

25
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:58,260
sacrifices you have made for me all

26
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,760
right let's make it the ingredients are

27
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:02,399
actually very simple there's absolutely

28
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:05,610
no way you can mess this up all you need

29
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:08,430
is instant coffee milk hot water and

30
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:10,080
sugar I don't have sugar but I do have

31
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:11,790
honey it's basically the same thing I

32
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,340
don't have hot water but I have cold

33
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:17,430
water it's close enough I don't have a

34
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:21,299
measuring spoon but I do have this

35
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:22,619
Jewish amatsu gigantic spoon it's

36
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:24,990
actually better than a measuring cup

37
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:28,170
also I don't have an electric mixer but

38
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:30,600
I have my hand and mixer so what more do

39
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:33,030
you need science has taken us too far

40
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:35,009
perhaps we have forgotten that we have

41
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:37,860
hands everything is supposed to be like

42
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:41,100
a 1 1 1 ratio response it it's not it

43
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:48,079
but if they want to sponsor me okay keep

44
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:48,079
one scoop of this instant coffee in oh

45
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:55,970
that's ok it's gonna evaporate so

46
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:05,250
all right sugar

47
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:06,149

like this wall because they see my

52
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:27,810
reflection on it and it makes me think

53
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:29,100
about what I'm doing to myself if I

54
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:35,790

I'm not allowed to change how I look

61
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,900
without their permission

62
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:59,820
but my body is naturally changing how I

63
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:03,650
look there for making me break company

66
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:16,709
that they hate themselves no matter how

67
00:03:15,329 --> 00:03:18,959
much time you have during this

68
00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:20,370
